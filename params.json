{"name":"Rhinodo","tagline":"Execute Node modules in the JVM (powered by Rhino)","body":"# Rhinodo\r\n\r\n### What is Rhinodo? \r\nThe basic idea behind Rhinodo is to enable running 'node.js' modules in the JVM. So it can be said that it's a compatibility layer that allows you to run 'node' using Mozilla's 'rhino' Javascript implementation. So, it can be said that Rhinodo is to Node what JRuby is to Ruby.\r\n\r\n### How to build\r\nIn order to build, execute the following command:\r\n\r\n    mvn clean install\r\n\r\n### How to run\r\nOnce build just set the `RHINODO_HOME` variable to where the `uberjar` can be found. Usually, that would be you `target` folder.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nexport RHINODO='path/to/rhinodo/target'\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd after that just run:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n./rhinodo\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn case you want to connect to it for remote debuggig, you can use:\r\n```sh\r\n./rhinodo-debug\r\n``` \r\n\r\nand point your IDE to port 5555.\r\n\r\n## Useful info\r\n\r\n### Which native modules are (partially) supported?\r\nCurrently, the modules are created on demand as we need them. Most of the functions in the `fs` module had been implemented. Also, `vm` and `path` module are pretty complete too.\r\n\r\n### How are the native modules implemented?\r\nSome native modules are implemented using Java, others using Javascript.\r\n\r\n### How Node.js async model has been implemented?\r\nA queue is used to keep track of all the callback functions that need to be executed. When the queue is empty the program has ended as there is no more code to execute :)\r\n\r\n### What's the roadmap?\r\nThe idea is that in a near future all the necessary `.js` files will be obtained from the official node repo. \r\nIn order to do that, the plan to add the repository as a Git submodule (it won't be an easy task). Once the node\r\nrepo is embedded, it can be used to run node.js tests.\r\n\r\n##Misc \r\n\r\n### Authors\r\nAlberto Pose (@thepose)\r\n\r\n### License\r\nCopyright 2012 MuleSoft, Inc.
